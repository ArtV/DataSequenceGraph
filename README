Data Sequence Graph represents a collection of data value sequences (IEnumerable<T>), 
called "chunks", as possibly overlapping one-way routes in a single graph. The singular 
MasterNodeList for the graph stores every node, and each node stores its outgoing edges 
to other nodes. The computeFullRoute() method of the DataChunkRouteBlazer object, 
constructed with the original data value sequence and the desired MasterNodeList, 
will make all necessary changes to encode the chunk in the graph.
