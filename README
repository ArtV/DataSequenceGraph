Data Sequence Graph represents one or more data value sequences (IEnumerable<>), called "chunks", as nodes and edges in a common graph. The singular MasterNodeList for the graph stores every node, and each node stores its outgoing edges to other nodes. The computeFullRoute() method of the DataChunkRouteBlazer object, constructed with the original data value sequence and the desired MasterNodeList, will make all necessary changes to encode the chunk in the graph.
